# Changelog

All notable changes to Glonass Import API will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **GPS Status Tracking System**
  - New fields in Vehicle entity:
    - `gpsStatus` (online/offline/unknown) - Current GPS status
    - `lastServerDataTime` - Copy of last position time for clarity
    - `connectionStatus` (connected/disconnected/no_data) - Terminal connection status
    - `statusCheckedAt` - Timestamp of last status check
  - `Vehicle::updateGpsStatus()` - Automatically determine GPS status based on data freshness
    - Online: Last position within 2 hours
    - Offline: Last position older than 2 hours
    - Unknown: No position data available
  - `Vehicle::isGpsOnline()` - Quick check if GPS is online
  - `Vehicle::hasGpsData()` - Check if vehicle has any GPS data

- **Status Update Command & Automation**
  - `app:update:vehicle-status` - Console command to update GPS statuses
    - `--async` flag for background processing
    - `--vehicle-id` to update specific vehicle
    - Uses batch processing for all vehicles
  - `UpdateVehicleStatusMessage` & Handler for Messenger integration
  - Suitable for cron automation (every 2 hours recommended)

- **UI Enhancements for GPS Status**
  - GPS Status Overview dashboard with statistics:
    - Online count (green badge)
    - Offline count (red badge)
    - Unknown count (gray badge)
    - Total vehicles count
  - GPS Status filter dropdown in vehicles list
    - Filter by online/offline/unknown
    - Combined with search and pagination
  - Status badges in vehicles table:
    - üü¢ Online (green) - GPS working, recent data
    - üî¥ Offline (red) - GPS not responding, old data
    - ‚ö™ Unknown (gray) - No GPS data available
  - "Status Checked" column showing last verification time
  - "Last Position" column enhanced with server data time

- **Repository Enhancements**
  - `VehicleRepository::findWithPaginationAndSearch()` - Added `$gpsStatusFilter` parameter
  - `VehicleRepository::getGpsStatusStatistics()` - Get counts by status

### Changed
- `ParseVehiclesMessageHandler` now automatically updates GPS status when importing vehicles
- Vehicles index page layout reorganized with status dashboard
- Search form combined with status filter and page size selector
- Pagination links preserve GPS status filter

### Technical Details
**GPS Status Logic:**
- Status determined by comparing `lastPositionTime` with current time
- Threshold: 2 hours (configurable via `updateGpsStatus($hours)` parameter)
- Automatic updates on vehicle import and manual status refresh
- Batch processing prevents memory issues with large vehicle counts

**Automation Setup:**
```bash
# Add to crontab for automatic updates every 2 hours
0 */2 * * * cd /path/to/project && php bin/console app:update:vehicle-status --async
```

## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **Pagination & Search for Vehicles Page**
  - Implemented pagination with customizable page size (10, 25, 50, 100 items per page)
  - Added search functionality across name, plateNumber, and externalId fields
  - Bootstrap 5 pagination UI with "Previous/Next" buttons and page numbers
  - Page size selector dropdown with auto-submit
  - Results counter showing "–ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω—ã –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∏ X-Y –∏–∑ Z"
  - Search results counter showing "–ù–∞–π–¥–µ–Ω–æ: X –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–µ–π"
  - "Reset" button to clear search and show all results
  - All state preserved in URL parameters (bookmarkable pages)
  - Graceful handling of empty search results

### Changed
- `VehicleRepository::findWithPaginationAndSearch()` - New method for paginated queries
  - Case-insensitive search using LOWER() SQL function
  - OR conditions for searching across multiple fields
  - Returns both results array and total count
- `VehicleWebController::index()` - Updated to handle query parameters
  - Accepts `q` (search query), `page` (current page), `limit` (items per page)
  - Validates limit to allowed values [10, 25, 50, 100]
  - Passes pagination state to template
- `templates/vehicle/index.html.twig` - Complete UI overhaul
  - Search form with input field and buttons
  - Page size selector
  - Bootstrap pagination component
  - Improved empty state messages

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **Batch Processing for Vehicle Import**
  - Process 12,138 vehicles in batches of 100 to avoid memory exhaustion
  - `ParseVehiclesMessageHandler::processBatch()` - Batch processing with memory management
  - EntityManager::flush() after each batch
  - EntityManager::clear() to free memory between batches
  - Detailed progress logging for each batch
  - Successfully processes large datasets without exceeding PHP memory limits

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Fixed vehicles parsing - API returns array directly, not wrapped object
  - `getVehicles()` was looking for `$response['Vehicles']` but API returns vehicles array directly
  - Was returning 0 vehicles when API actually returned 12138+ vehicles
  - Now correctly handles both response formats (direct array or wrapped in 'Vehicles' key)
- **Critical:** Fixed empty request body issue in GlonassApiClient
  - Empty array `[]` was being sent as `[]` instead of empty object `{}`
  - API requires `{}` for empty request bodies, not `[]`
  - Now converts empty array to `stdClass()` which JSON-encodes to `{}`
- **Fixed:** X-Auth header was being added even when `requiresAuth=false`
  - Now properly checks `$requiresAuth` flag before adding X-Auth header
  - Login endpoint no longer receives unnecessary null X-Auth header
- **Fixed:** Request body logging caused error with stdClass
  - Added proper type checking before logging request body
  - Now logs JSON string representation of objects

### Changed
- POST/PUT/PATCH requests always send JSON body (even if empty as `{}`)
- GET requests only add query params if data is not empty
- Added debug logging for request body to help troubleshoot API issues

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit test coverage
  - 59 unit tests with 118 assertions
  - Tests for Message classes (ParseVehiclesMessage, ParseVehicleHistoryMessage, ParseVehicleTracksMessage)
  - Tests for Entity classes (Vehicle, VehicleTrack, CommandHistory)
  - Tests for GlonassApiClient service with mocks
  - PHPUnit configuration with test bootstrap
  - Test documentation in README
- **Authentication Check:**
  - `GlonassApiClient::checkAuth()` - New method to check authentication status via GET /api/v3/auth/check
  - `app:auth:check` - New console command to verify authentication status through API
- **Debug Logging:** Added debug logging to verify token transmission
  - `GlonassApiClient::authenticate()` now logs masked auth token when received
  - `GlonassApiClient::makeRequest()` logs request headers including X-Auth token
  - New helper method `maskToken()` for secure token display (shows first/last 4 chars)
  - New public method `getAuthToken()` for debugging purposes
- **Testing Commands:**
  - `app:debug:auth` - New command to verify authentication flow and token transmission
  - Updated `app:test:api` to display token information
- **Logging Infrastructure:**
  - Installed Symfony Monolog Bundle
  - Configured monolog with debug level logging in dev environment
  - Console handler for real-time log output with -vv flag
  - File handler writing to `var/log/dev.log`

### Changed
- Debug logs now show masked tokens (e.g., "ab12...xy89") instead of full tokens for security

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
- **Rate Limiting:** Improved rate limiting mechanism to guarantee at least 1 second delay between API requests
  - Fixed timing calculation to measure from END of previous request (not start)
  - Added proper time tracking in exception handlers
  - Added 10ms buffer to guarantee >= 1 second delay
  - All requests now correctly wait >= 1 second between calls

### Added
- **Testing Commands:**
  - `app:test:api` - Test API connection and authentication
  - `app:test:vehicle [VEHICLE_ID]` - Test getting specific vehicle by ID
  - `app:test:rate-limit` - Verify rate limiting works correctly with detailed timing measurements

### Changed
- **Rate Limiting Implementation:**
  - `GlonassApiClient::enforceRateLimit()` now calculates delay from last response completion
  - `lastRequestTime` is updated AFTER receiving response (not before sending request)
  - Exception handling ensures `lastRequestTime` is always updated even on errors
  - Added debug logging for rate limit waits

### Technical Details

**Before:**
```
Request 1 starts at T=0
Request 1 ends at T=0.900
Request 2 starts at T=0.900  ‚Üê Only 0.9 seconds from start of Request 1!
```

**After:**
```
Request 1 starts at T=0
Request 1 ends at T=0.900
[Wait 0.100 seconds]
Request 2 starts at T=1.000  ‚Üê Exactly 1+ second from end of Request 1!
```

This ensures compliance with Glonass API rate limit requirements.
